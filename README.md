# 2023_relaxed_selection_project
Revisiting code to my masters project. My old project/code are acting up on my new work computer, so creating a new project to clean up and circumnavigate the issue.

This is the readme file.

Masters_thesis_organization.R
- this R file analyzes GSI and egg diameter for the pink 2020, pink 2021, and full coho datasets. It spits out two csv's into the results folder, one for
--GSI and the other for egg. It also spits out the GSI/EGG graph into the Plots folder.

Bomb_final_simple_dec2023.Rmd
- this rmd analyzes the bomb data. There's some excess exploratory stuff in there, but essentially the file spits out one combined egg energy and lipid 
--csv into the Results folder and a two plots into the Plots folder: a boxplot (for the supplement) and a violin plot (we chose not to use this one, but it exists).
